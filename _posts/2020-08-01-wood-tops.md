Solid wood makes a beautiful and durable surface for a coffee table. All wooden tops will be constructed of solid planks joined together and finished with a durable top coat. We offer both hardwood and softwood species, which generally speaking is descriptive of the hardness of the wood, although the distinction actually has more to do with the reproductive process of the tree.

### Hardwoods

The beauty of hardwood is best enhanced with a clear or light protective finish.</p>

### Softwoods

<p><a href="{{ "/images/cedar-box.jpg" | absolute_url }}" data-lightbox="softwood" data-title="Dark Stained Cedar Top and Matte Black Box Base"><z class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/cedar-box-thumb.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></z></a>If a rustic aesthetic is preferred, softwoods are ideal as they will develop wear and signs of use with time. This table and the one below have been given a rough-sawn effect, the lumber has been reprocessed, leaving irregular circular saw marks on the surface of table.</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/images/greycedar.jpg" | absolute_url }}" data-lightbox="softwood" data-title="Pickled Cedar Top and Matte Black Box Base"><z class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/cedar-box-thumb.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></z></a>I always loved the way old cedar fences and park benches age and develop a faded grey, as though the colour has been washed out, it's something that can't be authentically reproduced by just adding pigment to the wood. The colouring on this table wasn't achieved using a grey stain but instead by "pickling" the wood, a process that accelerates the oxidation and dramatically ages the wood.</p>
