Solid wood makes a beautiful and durable surface for a coffee table. All wooden tops will be constructed of solid planks joined together and finished with a durable top coat. We offer both hardwood and softwood species, which generally speaking is descriptive of the hardness of the wood, although the distinction actually has more to do with the reproductive process of the tree.

### Hardwoods

The beauty of hardwood is best enhanced with a clear or light protective finish.</p>
